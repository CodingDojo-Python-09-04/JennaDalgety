My Bio!

I got interested in coding by a friend who took a Ruby bootcamp with Anyone Can Learn To Code.  I started messing around with Ruby, and code in general, and fell in love with it.  I get to use a different part of my brain than what my usual office work gives me, and I can really see when something I'm doing is working or not, and troubleshoot it.

My long term goal is a career change into coding.  I currently am an office manager at a comedy club, but want to transition into a field in which I can retire.

Short term goal would be to finish the bootcamp, become a full-stack developer and get a job in a year or so in coding.
